## Tutorial

`view_batch_size` (int, defaults to 16): The batch size for multiple denoising paths. Typically, a larger batch size can result in higher efficiency but comes with increased GPU memory requirements. <br />
`stride` (int, defaults to 64): The stride of moving local patches. A smaller stride is better for alleviating seam issues, but it also introduces additional computational overhead and inference time. <br />
`cosine_scale_1` (float, defaults to 3): Control the strength of skip-residual. For specific impacts, please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper. <br />
`cosine_scale_2` (float, defaults to 1): Control the strength of dilated sampling. For specific impacts, please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper. <br />
`cosine_scale_3` (float, defaults to 1): Control the strength of the Gaussian filter. For specific impacts, please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper. <br />
`sigma` (float, defaults to 1): The standard value of the Gaussian filter. Larger sigma promotes the global guidance of dilated sampling, but has the potential of over-smoothing. <br />
`multi_decoder` (bool, defaults to True): Determine whether to use a tiled decoder. Generally, when the resolution exceeds 3072x3072, a tiled decoder becomes necessary. <br />
`show_image` (bool, defaults to False): Determine whether to show intermediate results during generation. <br />
